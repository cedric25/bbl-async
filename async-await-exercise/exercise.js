/**
 * Instructions:
 *  - Call getOneNumber() two times
 *  - Call getSum() with these 2 numbers
 *  - console.log the result
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - getOneNumber() and getSum() are asynchronous and return promises!
 *  - Sometimes getOneNumber() will throw an error, handle it properly.
 *    (= I don't want to see any "UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning" in the console!)
